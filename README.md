**Hi. I'm Piero**

I'm a full-stack developer based in Lima, Peru. I’m passionate about web development, Linux, Neovim, command-line tools,
and self-hosting apps.

Most of my work revolves around building web applications using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**. I also enjoy
working with **Go** and **PostgreSQL**.

Outside of tech, I’m into coffee, music, lifting, and wrestling.
